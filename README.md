G-FOLD: Fuel Optimal Large Divert Guidance Algorithm

This project utilizes g-fold algorithm to optimize a landing trajectory based on input parameters, G-FOLD is a convex-optimization algorithm that generates fuel-optimal path to land a spacecraft at the desired location.

By default, the input parameters are representative of a small lunar lander:
